# New York Airbnb EDA

This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb listings in New York City for the year 2019. It utilizes visualizations and data exploration techniques to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about Airbnb rentals in the city. The dataset used for this analysis is publicly available on Kaggle.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Handles missing values in columns like `reviews_per_month` using imputation.
  - Removes unnecessary columns (`id`, `host_name`, `last_review`) for a cleaner dataset.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Word frequency analysis of listing names to uncover popular terms.
  - Analysis of neighborhood groups and room types.
  - Insights into pricing patterns across neighborhoods.
  - Visualizations of host activities and rental density.

- **Visualizations:**
  - Bar plots, pie charts, and scatter plots to understand distribution and relationships.
  - Factor plots for detailed comparisons of neighborhoods, room types, and boroughs.
  - Maps for price distribution based on latitude and longitude.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Environment:** Kaggle Notebook

## How to Use
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amark720/Machine-Learning-Projects.git
cd "NewYork AirBnb dataset EDA"
```

### Step 2: Download Dataset
Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) and place it in the project directory.

### Step 3: Run the Notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Kaggle Notebook and execute the code step by step to generate the visualizations and analysis.

## Areas of Further Improvement
- **Advanced NLP:** Perform sentiment analysis on the reviews to understand customer feedback.
- **Feature Engineering:** Add calculated features like price per square foot or demand score for deeper insights.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Use machine learning to predict price or booking demand based on the features.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Leverage tools like Plotly Dash or Tableau for enhanced interactivity.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Integrate APIs for live Airbnb data to keep the analysis up-to-date.

## Conclusion
This EDA provides valuable insights into the New York Airbnb market, highlighting key trends such as pricing disparities, popular neighborhoods, and host activity levels. The visualizations offer a comprehensive view of the data, which can be extended for predictive modeling or business strategy development.
