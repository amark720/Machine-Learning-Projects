## About the Original Repository  
The **Wine Quality Prediction WebApp** is a Machine Learning project that predicts wine quality using 11 features from a dataset of 3673 data points. It classifies wine as `Good`, `Average`, or `Bad` based on the predicted quality. The project is integrated with AWS for seamless deployment using CI/CD workflows.  

### Key Features:  
- **Prediction Model:** Uses a machine learning model trained on 3000 data points and tested on 673.  
- **Classification Categories:**  
  - Quality < 6: **Bad**  
  - Quality = 6: **Average**  
  - Quality > 6: **Good**  
- **WebApp Interface:** Interactive UI built with Python and Streamlit.  
- **End-to-End Deployment:** Deployed on AWS using Docker and GitHub Actions.
