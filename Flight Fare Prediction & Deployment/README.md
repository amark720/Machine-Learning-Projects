# Flight Fare Prediction!

The objective of this project is to predict the fare of a flight journey based on various parameters such as source, destination, number of stops, airline company, and more. The project includes a **Flask web application** for users to input journey details and receive an accurate fare prediction. The backend uses a machine learning model trained on a comprehensive dataset.
The project is implemented as a user-friendly web application deployed on Heroku.
